                Nonograms, also known as Paint by Numbers, Picross, Griddlers, Pic-a-Pix, and
                various other names, are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be
                colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a
                hidden picture. In this puzzle type, the numbers are a form of discrete tomography
                that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given
                row or column. For example, a clue of &quot;4 8 3&quot; would mean there are sets of
                four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square
                between successive sets.

                These puzzles are often black and white—describing a binary image—but they can also
                be colored. If colored, the number clues are also colored to indicate the color of
                the squares. Two differently colored numbers may or may not have a space in between
                them. For example, a black four followed by a red two could mean four black boxes,
                some empty spaces, and two red boxes, or it could simply mean four black boxes
                followed immediately by two red ones. Nonograms have no theoretical limits on size,
                and are not restricted to square layouts.

                Nonograms were named after a Japanese graphics editor Non Ishida, one of the two
                inventors of the puzzle, who in 1987 won a competition in Tokyo by designing grid
                pictures using skyscraper lights that were turned on or off. This led her to the
                idea of a puzzle based around filling in certain squares in a grid. Coincidentally,
                a professional Japanese puzzler named Tetsuya Nishio invented the same puzzles
                completely independently, and published them in another magazine.

                <h2>Print publishing</h2>
                Paint by numbers puzzles started appearing in Japanese puzzle magazines. Non Ishida
                published three picture grid puzzles in 1988 in Japan under the name of &quot;Window
                Art Puzzles&quot;. In 1990, James Dalgety in the UK invented the name Nonograms
                after Non Ishida, and The Sunday Telegraph started publishing them on a weekly
                basis. By 1993, the first book of nonograms was published by Non Ishida in Japan.
                The Sunday Telegraph published a dedicated puzzle book titled the &quot;Book of
                Nonograms&quot;. Nonograms were also published in Sweden, the United States
                (originally by Games magazine[2]), South Africa and other countries. The Sunday
                Telegraph ran a competition in 1998 to choose a new name for their puzzles.
                Griddlers was the winning name that readers chose.

                <h2>Electronic puzzles</h2>
                Paint by numbers puzzles were implemented by 1995 on hand held electronic toys such
                as Game Boy and on other plastic puzzle toys. Nintendo picked up on this puzzle fad
                and released two &quot;Picross&quot; (picture crossword) titles for the Game Boy and
                nine for the Super Famicom (eight of which were released in two-month intervals for
                the Nintendo Power Super Famicom Cartridge Writer as the NP series) in Japan. Only
                one of these, Mario&apos;s Picross for the Game Boy, was released outside Japan.
                Since then, one of the most prolific Picross game developers has been Jupiter
                Corporation, who released Picross DS on the Nintendo DS in 2007, 8 titles in the
                Picross e series for the Nintendo 3DS eShop (along with 5 character-specific titles,
                including ones featuring Pokémon, Zelda and Sanrio characters), and 5 titles in the
                Picross S series for the Nintendo Switch (along with two character-specific ones
                featuring Kemono Friends and Overlord respectively, with another one featuring
                SEGA&apos;s Master System and Genesis intellectual properties being in development).

                Increased popularity in Japan launched new publishers and by now there were several
                monthly magazines, some of which contained up to 100 puzzles. The Japanese arcade
                game Logic Pro was released by Deniam Corp in 1996, with a sequel released the
                following year. UK games developer Jagex released a nonogram puzzle in 2011 as part
                of their annual Halloween event for their role-playing game, Runescape. In 2013,
                Casual Labs released a mobile version of these puzzles called Paint it Back with the
                theme of restoring an art gallery. Released early in 2017, Pictopix has been
                presented as a worthy heir to Picross on PC by Rock, Paper, Shotgun.[3] In
                particular, the game enables players to share their creations.
